## Abstract

The rise of social media as a platform for expressing mental health concerns, particularly during crises, underscores the need for advanced tools to detect and classify mental health conditions from user-generated text. This study presents **MIBERT** (Mental Illness BERT), a domain-adaptive transformer model based on BERT, designed to enhance mental health detection in crisis-related social media content.

### Methodology

Leveraging a dataset sourced from Reddit subreddits, MIBERT is fine-tuned to classify text across eight categories: ADHD, Anxiety, Bipolar Disorder, Depression, PTSD, OCD, BPD, and None (indicating no mental health condition).
