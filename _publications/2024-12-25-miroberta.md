This paper proposes **MIRoBERTa**, a domain-adaptive RoBERTa model pretrained on Reddit mental health content to enhance multiclass text classification. The model outperforms other traditional, deep learning, and transformer baselines, achieving an F1-score of 0.847. The study also explores ensemble techniques and word importance to improve interpretability and prediction performance.
